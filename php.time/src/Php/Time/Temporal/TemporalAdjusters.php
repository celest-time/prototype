/**
 * Common and useful TemporalAdjusters.
 * <p>
 * Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects.
 * They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different
 * approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
 * Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that
 * sets the date to the last day of the month.
 * <p>
 * There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code TemporalAdjuster}.
 * The first is to invoke the method on the interface directly.
 * The second is to use {@link Temporal#adjust(TemporalAdjuster)}:
 * <pre>
 *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *   temporal = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal);
 *   temporal = temporal.adjust(thisAdjuster);
 * </pre>
 * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code adjust(TemporalAdjuster)},
 * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 * <p>
 * This class contains a standard set of adjusters, available as static methods.
 * These include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>finding the first or last day of the month
 * <li>finding the first day of next month
 * <li>finding the first or last day of the year
 * <li>finding the first day of next year
 * <li>finding the first or last day-of-week within a month, such as "first Wednesday in June"
 * <li>finding the next or previous day-of-week, such as "next Thursday"
 * </ul>
 *
 * @implSpec
 * All the implementations supplied by the static methods are immutable.
