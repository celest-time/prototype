 * A geographical region where the same time-zone rules apply.

 * Time-zone information is categorized as a set of rules defining when and
 * how the offset from UTC/Greenwich changes. These rules are accessed using
 * identifiers based on geographical regions, such as countries or states.
 * The most common region classification is the Time Zone Database (TZDB),
 * which defines regions such as 'Europe/Paris' and 'Asia/Tokyo'.
 * <p>
 * The region identifier, modeled by this class, is distinct from the
 * underlying rules, modeled by {@link ZoneRules}.
 * The rules are defined by governments and change frequently.
 * By contrast, the region identifier is well-defined and long-lived.
 * This separation also allows rules to be shared between regions if appropriate.
